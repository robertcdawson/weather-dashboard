I want to create a responsive web app that displays weather conditions for cities I specify, using a multi-column card layout where each card displays the weather in a different geographic location. The app should meet the following requirements:

### General Requirements

	1.	Use a free weather API (like ~[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)~, ~[Weatherstack](https://weatherstack.com/)~, or ~[Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)~) to fetch weather data.
	2.	Allow users to input and save a list of cities or ZIP codes. Use autocomplete suggestions to populate the location field accurately.
	3.	Persist the user’s city list and preferences (e.g., temperature units) using local storage or a database.
	4.	Include light/dark mode support.
	5.	Ensure responsiveness for mobile, tablet, and desktop. Use a mobile-first design approach.
	6.	Implement error handling:
* If an API request fails, show an error message like, “Could not fetch weather data for this location. Please try again later.”
* Handle invalid user input gracefully (e.g., unsupported ZIP codes).

### Card Design

**Front (Summary View):**

* Show the city, state, and country (in shortest form, e.g., “New York, NY, USA”).
* Display the current temperature in the user’s preferred unit (°C or °F).
* Include a brief weather condition (e.g., “Sunny,” “Light Rain”).

**Back (Detailed View):**

* Show the “feels like” temperature.
* Display wind speed and direction (e.g., “10 mph NE”).
* Include the Air Quality Index (AQI) with a simple descriptor (e.g., “45 - Good”), using a suitable API if available.

### UI/UX Features

	1.	**Interactive Cards**:
* Cards should be tappable (mobile) or clickable (desktop) to flip between front and back views. Allow the user to trigger the flip by clicking anywhere on the card or on a button.
  2.**Add/Remove Cities**:
* Provide an input field for users to add cities or ZIP codes, with autocomplete suggestions for accurate input.
* Allow users to delete cities from the list.
  3.**Dynamic Layout**:
* Use a multi-column grid for desktop (e.g., 3 columns), 2 columns for tablets, and 1 column for mobile.
  4.**Customization**:
* Allow users to toggle temperature units between °C and °F. Persist this preference.

### Enhancements (Optional)

	1.	Animate the card flip transition for smoother interaction.
	2.	Use color coding for AQI or weather severity.
	3.	Provide a refresh button for each card to manually update weather data.

### Technology Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (with Flexbox or Grid), and JavaScript. Consider using React for state management if needed.
* **Backend**: Use a simple Node.js or Python server (if required) for API calls and caching.
* **API**: Integrate with a free weather API (like Open-Meteo, Weatherstack, or OpenWeatherMap).

### Expected Output

A fully functional, responsive web app that displays weather information for user-specified cities in a clean, intuitive layout. Include comments in the code to explain key functionality.
